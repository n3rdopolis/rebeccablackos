To build, just run the included script. The build script only works on Ubuntu/Debain (I think it would work on Debian) based systems. 

Otherwise use the ISO here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/rebeccablackos/files/

This is inspired by Linux distributions of the same theme (Hannah Montana Linux, and Justin Beiber Linux) that have appeared in the Linux community, only this is Rebecca Black Linux. 

This has both Wayland and X. Even though QT, GTK, EFL, has been compiled on this CD to support Wayland, many apps don't work.

This distribution is fan made. Yes. I am a fan of Rebecca Black.

Problems:
      Wayland is still new, things are still unstable

      Won't fit on a normal CD.

      The spell checker doesn't recongise "Rebecca"... 

TODO:

      Need Creative Commons compatible images!

How to use the ISO:
  burn it, (or put it in a VM), reboot, set the BIOS to boot from the CD if it does not already, 
  boot from the CD. Once it boots you can use the live system. 
 
How to use Wayland:
    Either select the boot option to start Wayland native on hardware, or boot into X, and open Wayland nested, or open it on a tty

    Wayland programs are in /usr/local/bin or the panel at the top.
