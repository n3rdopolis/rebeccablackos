To build, just run the included script. This script only works on Ubuntu/Debain (I think it would work on Debian) based systems. 

This is inspired by Linux distributions of the same theme (Hannah Montana Linux, and Justin Beiber Linux) that have appeared in the Linux community, only this is Rebecca Black Linux. 

Oh yeah, it's also meant to be the first Wayland Live CD, instead of using X. (soon. hopefuly.) 

This distribution is fan made. Yes. I am a fan of Rebecca Black.

Problems:
      Wayland is still new

      Won't fit on a normal CD.

TODO:
      More Wayland toolkits built

      Replace X with Wayland

      Build the Wayland version of the Xserver (for rootless ability)

      Need Creative Commons compatible images!

How to use the ISO:
  burn it, (or put it in a VM), reboot, set the BIOS to boot from the CD if it does not already, 
  boot from the CD. Once it boots you can use the live system.
