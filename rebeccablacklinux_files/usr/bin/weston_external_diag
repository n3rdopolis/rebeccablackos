export WESTONDIAG="This is a External Diagnosis Terminal for Wayland to run Wayland programs
You also can launch weston-display-server (the command for the Wayland compositor) from here with custom parameters.
This only works when running under X11

To the weston command you can add 
--height=(number of pixels) 
--width=(number of pixels)
--output-count=(number of simulated screens)
--xserver to start an xwayland server

You will have to close any other instance running as your user account first.

You can have multiple weston diagnostic terminals open at the same time to open various clients, as well as the server"
