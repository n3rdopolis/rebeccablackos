echo "Installing virtualbox additions with this distro is not recommended as they don't appear to support Weston.
This script is currently unsupported, as the kernel mode setting driver that the virtualbox additions install is NOT compatible with weston. egl fails to initilize, and weston hangs even using pixman.

Virtualbox's framebuffer driver is much more reliable then the Virtualbox Kernel Mode setting drivers, and you are better off using that by configuring with rbos-add-framebuffer

if you still want to install virtualbox addtions andpossibly break weston, remove the exit line from $(readlink -f $0)"
