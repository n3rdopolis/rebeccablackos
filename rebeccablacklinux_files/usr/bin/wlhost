Grant and remove permissions from users to the current Wayland server

wlhost usage:
wlhost + username 
    Give the user username permission to the current WAYLAND_DISPLAY
wlhost - username
    Remove permissions from the user to the current WAYLAND_DISPLAY
wlhost @
    Give all users permissions to the Wayland server
wlhost 0
    Reset permissions to the Wayland server
wlhost ++
    Share the WAYLAND_DISPLAY publicly in /run/shm/waylandservers prefixed with the current users's UID
    for example if the user with the UID 1000 was running a WAYLAND_DISPLAY of wayland-0,
    it will be created as 1000-wayland-0 . In order to use it, you will need to export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    to /run/shm/waylandservers , and WAYLAND_DISPLAY as 1000-wayland-0
    NOTE: This does not set additional permissions.
wlhost --
    Unshare the WAYLAND_DISPLAY.
wlhost ?
    List all users that are have access to the WAYLAND_DISPLAY
wlhost ? username
    States if the user username has access to the WAYLAND_DISPLAY , and returns 0 if they do, and 1 if they don't.
