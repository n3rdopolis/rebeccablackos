#The Type of repository the source code is on. Either 'GIT', 'SVN', 'BZR', 'HG', or 'ARCHIVE'.
REPOSITORYTYPE=GIT

#The revision of the source repo to use. To get the lastest revision for GIT it's 'git:defaultbranch', for SVN it's 'HEAD', for BZR, it's 'last:1', and for HG it's 'default', without the quotes. ARCHIVE doesn't have revisions

#This variable is not manditory, /usr/bin/build_core sets it by default as 0, so that when it's set to create deb files, it only needs to build them once.

#This is an array where the first element specifies a submodule name, and the second element specifies the revision, the third specifies the name of another submodule, the fourth element specifies its revision and so on.
