#Configures GRUB to add 'nomodeset' and reboot automatically if there is no /dev/dri/card(x) device
#This covers for the case where a faulty driver or hardware issue (vmwgfx on QEMU's vmware card is a simulated example) may kick out simpledrm,
#Fail to initialize itself properly, and then be running without working graphics

#nomodeset is slightly misleading here, as despite the name, it does allow simpledrm to work, it just prevents other modesetting graphics drivers

#If there already is a /dev/dri/card(x) device, there is no need to act
if compgen -G '/dev/dri/card[0-9]*' >/dev/null
