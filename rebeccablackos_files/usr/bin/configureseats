Multiseat is not supported by all Wayland servers.

You will be able to select what seat devices belong to. 
The devices are remembered by the device's name (usually containing the make and model), 
and the port it's plugged into, so in order for the configuration to work each time you plug your devices, 
you need to plug them into the same port, (otherwise they will default to the default seat)

A seat in the Wayland sense is a group of input devices, such as a mouse and keyboard, window focus,
and clipboard and cursor. It is best to add at least 1 mouse device and 1 keyboard to each seat that 
you add devices to. You don't have to fill all seats with a device. 

This Dialog lists all the devices that will be configured by this wizard. 
You can close this dialog at anytime, as closing with will not interfere with the wizard, 
but serves as a guide to tell you how many devices are left.

Please note that some devices have multiple internal components, and sometimes register themselves more than once.
