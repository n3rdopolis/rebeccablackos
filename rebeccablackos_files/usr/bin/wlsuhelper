If programs are having problems running under a shared WAYLAND_DISPLAY as the user it was shared to, wlsuhelper will apply some workarounds

wlsuhelper usage:
XDG_RUNTIME_DIR must be set to the user's XDG_RUNTIME_DIR path that is sharing the server
WAYLAND_DISPLAY must be set to the name of the users shared Wayland server

wlsuhelper is to be called running as the guest user the server was shared to.
Under the main session it can be run as
su username -c wlsuhelper programname --args --args 2
or
sudo -E -u username wlsuhelper programname --args --args2

If you are already running a shell as the guest user the server was shared to you can run
wlsuhelper programname --args --args2"
